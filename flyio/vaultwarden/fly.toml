# FLY_APP in the `flyctl-secret.sops.yaml` will be used
# so I don't have to expose my app name
# Secrets created for this app are:
# - DATABASE_URL is set to fly postgres instance
# - DOMAIN is set to my own custom domain
# - SMTP_PASSWORD for sending invitation email
#
# In my Cloudflare DNS records, I have a domain CNAME to the app url
# with Cloudflare Proxy TURNED OFF so I can issue the certificate
# using `flyctl certs add` command
